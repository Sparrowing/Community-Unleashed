# Community Unleashed (Web)

A dynamic web application created for Purina's Better With Pets hackathon, October 13-15 2017.  View the DevPost page of the project [here](https://devpost.com/software/smartneighborhood), with more project and team information and a link to the original hackathon repository.

**Live demo coming soon!**

## Details

Originally created for the Better With Pets hackathon, and built on further to fill in feature holes from the limited time frame.  As our sole web developer I've forked from the original repository to clean the code up afterwards and finish implementing any unfinished features.

Our team faced challenges both in having different ideas for the project as well as little to no overlapping skillsets, and being largely non-coders.  I personally came into the weekend without any real knowledge of JavaScript front-end development - but that changed fast as I learned it on the fly for this project!

Also, go ahead and check out the sister iOS application coded by [Amanda Rawls](https://github.com/amandarawls), located [here](https://github.com/SmartNeighborhood/BetterWithPets2017)!

## Features

* Google Maps JavaScript API integration to create a map with custom-generated markers based on database information.
* Dynamically-updated content using AJAX.
* Sleek, visually pleasing UI.
* Integration with a database on the back-end to store persistent data.
* A simple REST API for fetching information.

## Uses

* [Bootstrap CSS](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/) for basic page styling.
* [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) for generation of the event map.
* [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/) as an ORM tool for database-related tasks.
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for dependency management.
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) as a relational database.
* [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) for back-end logic and controllers.
* [Thymeleaf](http://www.thymeleaf.org/) as a template engine.

## Languages

* Java (Spring Boot, Hibernate)
* JavaScript (Google Maps API, AJAX, JQuery, Bootstrap)
* HTML (Thymeleaf)
* CSS (Bootstrap)

## Status

**Functional upon the end of hackathon, but undergoing some code clean-up.**

To-Do -
* Validation/sanitization of user input so users may create their own accounts and event markers.
* Fix the partially-functional database saving.
* General clean-up/documenting.
